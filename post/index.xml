      <title>What to do if you accidentally delete an entire bigquery dataset</title>

      <description>A quick note on a particular feature of bigquery that I did not see anywhere in the documentation. If you accidentally delete a single table, you can use a feature called timetravel to restore the state of that table from a previous point in time. The way to do this:
1  bg cp my_data_set.my_deleted_table@1234567890 my_data_set.my_restored_table   If you have deleted the entire dataset however, the above method will fail.</description>

      <title>Fixing could not load vgui2_s.so error with Steam</title>

      <description>Occasionally steam updates seem to update bundled libraries in such a way that breaks everything. This results in an error dialog that points you to this knowledge base page: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9205-OZVN-0660 which in my case did not prove helpful. Using ldd as they suggested showed that everything was seemingly fine- all needed dependencies were present. Instead what proved to be the issue was problematic versions of certain libraries bundled in the steam runtime- the 3 libraries shown below.</description>

      <title>Sound only usable as root?</title>

      <description>Similar to the issue I ran into with my keyboard and mouse, following a bunch of updates, my soundcard was only usable as root. I checked the permissions of all the nodes in /dev/snd/* and saw they were indeed exclusively accessible by root. Running this:
1  sudo setfacl -m g:audio:rw /dev/snd/*   Allowed all users in the audio group to at least list the available sound cards via: 1  aplay -l   Previously, the above command would return an empty list.</description>

      <title>Keyboard and mouse only working as root in Xorg?!</title>

      <description>Ran into an issue which seems fairly common, but my particular steps to diagnose and &amp;ldquo;solve&amp;rdquo; the problem were not easy to figure out. After updating an old gentoo box that hadn&amp;rsquo;t been thoroughly updated in years, I ran into a problem where my keyboard and mouse were only accessible as root once I was in X. I could use the keyboard as myself in the console but as soon as I ran startx, it become unresponsive.</description>

      <title>How to show chrome URL paths in chrome 87</title>
      <link>https://www.sebortiz.com/post/how_to_show_chrome_url_paths/</link>

      <guid>https://www.sebortiz.com/post/how_to_show_chrome_url_paths/</guid>
      <description>For reasons completely unfathomable to me, recent versions of chrome decided it would be nice to hide pretty much every aspect of the URL shown in your searchbar/omnibox other than the top level domain. So if you are on https://www.sebortiz.com/some-blog-post chrome 87 will inexplicably just show you nothing more than sebortiz.com until you click into the box at which point it deigns to reveal some details. This behavior is infuriating to say the least.</description>

      <title>How to set Hugo baseURL with custom domain</title>
      <link>https://www.sebortiz.com/post/hugo_baseurl_with_custom_domain/</link>

      <guid>https://www.sebortiz.com/post/hugo_baseurl_with_custom_domain/</guid>
      <description>Hugo&amp;rsquo;s documentation is not entirely clear on the format of the baseURL value in config.toml when using github pages with a custom domain. When using a custom domain, you need to add the file static/CNAME whose contents are only the CNAME of your site (www.sebortiz.com in the case of this site). However, the baseURL value does seem to require the protocol as well (I guess this is implied by URL in the name&amp;hellip;), so in the case of this site https://www.</description>

      <title>Tensorflow with cuda support via docker in Gentoo</title>
      <link>https://www.sebortiz.com/post/tensorflow-docker-in-gentoo/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting tensorflow configured properly with cuda in gentoo is a bit of a mess because of versioning issues (and in my case some mystifying compile time issue with sqlite3). I decided to punt on getting everything compiled from scratch and instead try the docker route recommended on the tensorflow site&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
